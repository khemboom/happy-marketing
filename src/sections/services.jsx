              <p>
                One of the major advantages of digital marketing is that it is highly trackable and measurable.
                This will allow business owners and marketers to learn what is successful with consumers 
                and adapt their marketing messages moving forward.
                Understanding all of this data and using it to make good strategic decisions is an important 
                part of the business, and one that sets them apart from their traditional counterparts.
